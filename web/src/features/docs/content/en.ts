| \`GET /v1/videos/{id}/content\` | Download the video |

Every video model uses these three endpoints; to switch models, change the \`model\` parameter. Models differ in resolution, duration and billing, see Choosing a model below. The model descriptions in the [Model Square](/pricing) always show the latest specs and live prices.`,

| \`seedance-2.0-fast\` | 480p / 720p | 4–15 s | Per second |

| \`sd-2.0-线路1-fast\` | 720p | 4–15 s | Per second |

| \`wan3.0-超限\` | 480p / 720p / 1080p | 5–30 s | Per second |

**How to choose**

- **High definition or 4K**: \`seedance-2.0\` (up to 4K) or \`seedance-2.5\` (up to 1080p);
- **Long clips**: the Seedance 2.5 models and \`wan3.0-超限\` go up to 30 seconds per clip;
- **Faster and cheaper**: \`seedance-2.0-fast\`, \`seedance-2.0-mini\`;
- **Many reference files**: \`sd-2.5-线路1（2.5）\`, \`seedance-2.5-G2-V\` and \`seedance-2.5-g4-m1-官转\` take up to 30 reference images, 10 reference videos and 10 reference audio clips;
- **Long clips on a budget**: \`seedance-2.5-G2-V\` and \`seedance-2.5-g4-m1-官转\` charge per video, so longer clips cost less per second.

**Aspect ratio**: \`seedance-2.0\`, \`seedance-2.0-fast\`, \`seedance-2.0-mini\` and \`seedance-2.5\` support \`16:9\`, \`9:16\`, \`1:1\`, \`21:9\`, \`4:3\`, \`3:4\`; \`seedance-2.5-G2-V\`, \`seedance-2.5-g4-m1-官转\` and \`wan3.0-超限\` support only \`16:9\`, \`9:16\`, \`1:1\`.

**Other limits**: the \`sd-2.0-线路1\` models take up to 9 reference images, 3 reference videos and 3 reference audio clips; \`wan3.0-超限\` takes up to 10 reference images and 5 reference audio clips and no reference video; \`seedance-2.5-g4-m1-官转\` accepts prompts of up to 15,000 characters.`,

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \`model\` | \`string\` | Yes | Model name, see Choosing a model |
| \`prompt\` | \`string\` | Yes | Text description of the video; must not be empty |
| \`seconds\` | \`integer\` | No | Duration in whole seconds, within the model's range; 5 when omitted |
| \`resolution\` | \`string\` | No | \`480p\`, \`720p\`, \`1080p\` or \`4k\`, one the model supports; 720p when omitted (480p for the 480p-only model) |
| \`ratio\` | \`string\` | No | Aspect ratio such as \`16:9\`, \`9:16\`, \`1:1\`; see Choosing a model for the values |
| \`images\` | \`string[]\` | No | Public URLs of reference images |
| \`videos\` | \`string[]\` | No | Public URLs of reference videos |
| \`audios\` | \`string[]\` | No | Public URLs of reference audio |
| \`first_image_url\` | \`string\` | No | Public URL of the first-frame image |
| \`last_image_url\` | \`string\` | No | Public URL of the last-frame image; use together with \`first_image_url\` |

**Alternative forms**: \`duration\` is the same as \`seconds\`; if you send both they must be equal. \`size\` sets the resolution as a pixel size: \`854x480\`, \`480x854\`, \`1280x720\`, \`720x1280\`, \`720x720\`, \`1920x1080\`, \`1080x1920\`, \`3840x2160\` or \`2160x3840\`; if you also send \`resolution\` the two must match.

**Each task generates one video**, so do not send \`n\`. Parameters not listed here are not guaranteed to take effect.

A duration or resolution outside the model's range is rejected at submission, with no charge.`,

It depends on the model, duration, resolution and queue length. Rely on the polled status and avoid short client timeouts.

**Can I use the OpenAI SDK?**
Paths and responses follow the OpenAI video API, so plain HTTP requests work well. Use the parameters in this document.

**How do I use a local image?**
The API only takes public URLs. Upload the image to object storage or an image host first, then pass its link.

**Some model names contain Chinese characters. Is that a problem?**
No. Send the model name exactly as shown, brackets included, in a UTF-8 JSON body.

**How long is the video kept?**
The download link is temporary. Download and save the video soon after the task completes.`,
